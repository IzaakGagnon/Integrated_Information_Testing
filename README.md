# Integrated Information Testing

This project outlines my progress in computing/approximating the Integrated Information $\phi$ used in the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness. See https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi .

## This repository supports the following features:

### Randomly Generating Conditionally Independent Transition Probability Matrices of the Following Forms:
 - Stochastic TPM's
 - Deterministic TPM's

## Methods of Computing $\phi$
### Computing the Exact Value of $\phi$ Using [Pyphi]( https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi).
 - Examples
### Approximations of $\phi$
 - Random Sampling of Partitions
 - Partition Type Restriction Methods: Evaluating BI/TRI Partition Networks
